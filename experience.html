                                    <h3>DAPHNE - Open Source Data Analysis Language</h3>
                                    <p class="position">Berlin, Germany</p>
                                    <p class="date">March 2025 - August 2025</p>
                                    <p>
                                        During my time abroad at Technical University Berlin, I worked on the development of a data analysis pipeline
                                        called Daphne. Daphne is a custom domain-specific language (DSL) for large-scale data analysis.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        My contributions involved extending the capabilities of the DaphneDSL to make the platform more accessible to different data analysis use cases.
                                        I converted data structures coded in high-level languages to be compatible with DaphneDSL. As it is still a prototype language, I had to modify algorithms to work in DaphneDSL's constraints.
                                        Whenever the language was missing a crucial data structure for an algorithm, I would extend the languages functionality by making additions to its open source repo.
                                        Specifically, using C++, I enhanced core data structure functionality by extending list objects to support the insertion and deletion of matrices of varying sizes,
                                        which improved the language's flexibility for complex data manipulation.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        As this is a public open source project, I had to make sure that the changes I made were compatible with the existing codebase.
                                        This included creating unit tests, writing documentation, and writing detailed descriptions for my pull requests to ensure that the features I added were not breaking any existing functionality and that other developers could easily understand the changes I made.

                                    <h3>UC Online - Automated Frontend UI Testing</h3>
                                    <p class="position">University of California Office of the President—California</p>
                                    <p class="date">June 2024 - September 2024</p>
                                    <p>
                                        As a Software Developer Intern with the University of California Office of the President, I was tasked with reviving and expanding the automated front-end UI testing suite for the UC Online platform.
                                        Working in an agile environment and using Jira to manage tasks, I developed automated regression tests with Python, Selenium, and Pytest.
                                        These tests verified that essential functions—such as user login, course creation, and student enrollment—remained fully operational on the Salesforce-backed platform after any updates.<br><br>

                                        When I began my internship, the test suite had been non-functional for three years, accumulating significant technical debt.
                                        My primary objective was to first resolve these foundational issues before adding new tests. I refactored the entire codebase to be more flexible and resilient, ensuring it would not break with minor, unexpected changes to the Salesforce website's HTML.
                                        This process included optimizing the class structure with object inheritance, which not only eliminated the technical debt but also reduced the codebase by 60%. <br><br>

                                        Throughout the project, I followed a test plan created by my manager, meeting with him frequently to address constraints and modify our strategy.
                                        A key focus of my work was ensuring the long-term maintainability of the test suite.
                                        To achieve this, I wrote extensive documentation for the code and processes, making it easy for future developers to use, understand, and extend the test suite long after my internship concluded.
